# Regenerate-image-metadata
This simple script will help to rebuild the metadata that is missing from images
- Copy the code from 'regen-meta.php' file
- Create a file within the Theme directory(wp-content/theme/your-theme-name/)
- Add the code and save the changes
- When you're done, open a new tab and try to access the file from your site. For example:- "domain.com/wp-content/theme/your-theme-name/regen-meta.php"

[You may encounter an error after loading. Don't worry about that as I haven't added any success message there. But, the Meta information will be generated that you can verify by checking the Database]

That's it! Thank you.
