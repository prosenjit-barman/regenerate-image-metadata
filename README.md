# regenerate-image-metadata
This simple script will help to rebuild the metadata that are missing from images

Just create a file in wp-content/theme/your-theme-name/

Add the code and save the changes

When you're done, access the file from your site. For example example.com/wp-content/theme/<your-theme-name>/regen-meta.php

That's it!
